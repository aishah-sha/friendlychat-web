### **Discussion**
    In this personal assignment, I discovered how to create a chat application/website by following the guidelines given by Codelab. For this project, I employed Flutter as the programming language. During the course of the project, I faced several obstacles. Even though they weren't significant problems, I found them a bit challenging to address. A major issue I encountered was not being able to access my profile or see others' profiles on my chatting platform, Friendly Chat. The profile images were frequently absent, and occasionally, when I powered off my laptop or exited the Friendly Chat app, I discovered that my profile became inaccessible upon reopening it. 
    
    I reached out to my classmates for help with this problem since I had tried multiple solutions without any luck. Fortunately, my classmate can fix this issue by redoing a portion of the instructions for the profile image in Codelab, pasting it into the Firebase database, and also pasting it in VSCode. After they refresh, the profile picture thankfully reappears. In spite of these difficulties, I discovered the project to be very fulfilling. It proved to be a significant learning opportunity, as it entailed working through various platforms such as GitHub, Firebase Console, and Visual Studio Code. 

    Through Flutter, I discovered how to build responsive user interfaces and efficiently manage state, essential skills for creating contemporary applications. Furthermore, I acquired practical experience with Flutter's extensive collection of widgets and libraries, allowing me to create a visually attractive and effective chat app. 

    Using GitHub has shown me how crucial version control and teamwork are in software development. I discovered how to handle my codebase, monitor modifications, and work well with others, which are crucial abilities in any development setting. 

    Although I faced fewer issues than some of my classmates, I consistently adhered to the guidelines set by Codelab and my lecturer. Fortunately, the development journey progressed seamlessly, and my laptop functioned dependably during the entire project. In general, this experience has greatly improved my abilities in app development and problem-solving. 


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
